This is the code that was used for all time-frequency and behavioral analyses for the paper : 

Subthalamic nucleus local field potentials recordings reveal subtle effects of promised reward during conflict resolution in Parkinson's disease.

It is mostly inspired by Mike X Cohen's code based on published equation described in his book: Analyzing neural time series (MIT Press).
There's definitely room for improvement, especially in the R code, but the code does correct computations.
